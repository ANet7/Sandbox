====== README ======
Section about the project.

===== Section 1 =====
I'm going to make a whole bunch of commits.

===== Section 2 =====
Some other section I added later, will create a new commit for, but I'd like to push to the remote repository with a single commit so I'll try an interactive rebase before.

===== FOOTER =====
This section was added by someone else.
